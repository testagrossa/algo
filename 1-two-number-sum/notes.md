A. brute force, tries all possible combinations of inputs to find the expected result.
usually its the worst performant but its the easiest way to find the correct solution

B. dynamic programming, sacrifices space to obtain the most performant solution in time
by storing historical values that you will look up later in the process to satisfy an equation.

C. ???, by sorting the vector space now he obtains mathematical properties over it
which later exploits by traversing the structure with two pointers used to satisfy an equation
or to find the best approximation to the target solution (either by moving the left pointer or the right)
